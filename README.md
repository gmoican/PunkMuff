## Introduction
This is a simple vst3/au distortion plugin made with [JUCE](https://juce.com/) that I built to introduce myself in the JUCE framework. The functionality is somewhat inspired by the [Big Muff Pi](https://www.electrosmash.com/big-muff-pi-analysis), but I implemented my own processing without trying out the original pedal.

## Features
- **Mode**: Adjusts the frequencies modified by the tone control to emulate the following pedals:
    - Mode 1: Big Muff Pi.
    - Mode 2: Elk Sustainer
    - Mode 3: Custom modification
- **Sustain**: Sets the gain before the clipping processing.
- **Tone**: Adjust the frequency response after the clipping.
- **Level**: Adjust the output gain.
